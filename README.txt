	I have created web site for astrum education cacademy since they are IT  school it was preet hard to create their web site tey mostly used JS and so on. However, I did my best to create their website with html, css and simple JS code. I have not used iany library, which really helped me to understand html and js better. I had to to lots of research to get the right design. For example some on lline tutorial on youtube, and I had to scrool through orignal website which give me good empression about their codes to get right sizes for every photo and for css. I faced many problems including media query because it was unrecognized topic for me. Tutorial was hard but it toor really a lot for me to understand it. Core of that was typically difficult. I called youtube for that again. Many many tutorials it was hard and I finnally got it I took help from teachers as well and my friends.
